# GPU programming

This repos is about hand on experience on GPU programming and the following are focused:
1. Tensorflow -- The verification of tensorflow is impleneted at [link](https://github.com/hamzafar/GPU_Computation/blob/master/TensorFlow%20installation%20verification.ipynb)
2. Graph programming
3. Control programming
4. [Forcing Cpu or Gpu](https://github.com/hamzafar/GPU_Computation/blob/master/Using%20Gpu-Cpu.ipynb) -- to run computation on cpu or gpu

---
Using Tensorflow we can do scientific computation; that would result in time efficiency. The Risk according to API-581 (American Petroleum Institue) is calculated on sample data to validate time performance.

The detail work flow is https://github.com/hamzafar/GPU_Computation/blob/master/scientific_computation_cpu_vs_gpu.md
